__As part of the process of co-creating the Covid Memorial__, [Commissioned Artists t s Beall and Katie Anderson](../../about/the-artists) worked with communities across Dumfries and Galloway for 5 months in 2022 ([Phase 1](../../about/phase-1)). The Artists brought postcard-making workshops to large public events (like the Wigtown Book Festival and Dumfries’ Rood Fair) and smaller community groups (including NHS staff, unpaid carers, young people, and New Scots). The workshops were designed to encourage people to share their experiences over Lockdown, and to help decide the shape of D&G’s Covid Memorial.

The workshop included block printing, and three questions which the artists used as conversational prompts:

- About the Covid pandemic, what do you want to remember?
- About lockdown, what do you wish you could forget, or let go of?
- Within D&G, how should we collectively remember the pandemic?

The conversations and ideas shared during postcard-making workshops were central to the collaborative process that shaped _The Dispersed Memorial Forest_. Many of the handwritten stories from the postcards have been inscribed onto the sculptural markers which are part of the Memorial.
