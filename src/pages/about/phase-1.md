In Dumfries & Galloway, commissioned artists t s Beall and Katie Anderson worked with communities to collaboratively design and plant _**The Dispersed Memorial Forest**_ across the region. The artists began working with communities in 2022, exploring how to remember and honour those impacted by Covid. Between July-December 2022 (Phase 1), the artists brought a sculptural ‘Tree of Remembrance’ to public events across D&G, and hosted postcard-making workshops and conversational events with community groups – including NHS staff, young people, and unpaid carers.  These activities were designed to encourage people to share their experiences, and to help decide the shape of D&G’s Covid Memorial.

In workshops and conversations during Phase 1, the artists spoke to approximately 835 people from Stranraer to Sanquhar. Through those conversations, they identified three key elements for the memorial: _**The Dispersed Memorial Forest**_, a series of tree-planting and Community Gathering events, and an Archive sharing stories of loss and resilience from across the region. The artists asked what people wanted to remember about lockdown, and what they wished they could forget or let go off. Some of their answers, collected as a series of postcards, are inscribed into the sculptural markers that are installed on each forest site.
