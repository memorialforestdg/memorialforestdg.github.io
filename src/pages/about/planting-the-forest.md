In March and April 2024, the Remembering Together D&G project planted over 400 trees at five locations across the region as part of The Dispersed Memorial Forest, working alongside local site partners and community groups, as well as individuals and families affected during the COVID19 pandemics.

The tree planting events, working with partners alongside woodland planting experts [TreeSurv](https://www.treesurv.co.uk/), took place at key sites selected during the first phase of the project:

- Dumfries, with trees planted across The Crichton and NHS Mountainhall sites
- Moffat Community Nature Reserve
- Threave Nature Reserve at Castle Douglas
- Bell Crescent Playing Field in Sanquhar
- NHS Galloway Community Hospital in Stranraer

To mark the opening for each of the sites, the project hosted a series of community gathering events at each location in June 2024, with activities including walks, sharing stories, music and food.
