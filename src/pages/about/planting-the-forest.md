__In March and April 2024, the <i>Remembering Together D&G</i> project__ planted over 400 trees at five locations across the region as part of <i>The Dispersed Memorial Forest</i>, working with local partners and community groups, alongside individuals and families impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Tree Planting Events

The Tree Planting events were led by the artists and <a href="https://www.treesurv.co.uk/">TreeSurv</a>, an organisation specialising in the planting of native woodlands who were brought on as consultants. Events were hosted at each of the five sites selected during the <a href="../phase-1">Phase 1</a> of the project:

- Dumfries, with trees planted across The Crichton and NHS Mountainhall Treatment Centre
- Moffat Community Nature Reserve
- Threave Nature Reserve at Castle Douglas
- Bell Crescent Playing Field in Sanquhar
- NHS Galloway Community Hospital in Stranraer

To mark the opening at each place, the project hosted a series of Community Gatherings in June 2024, with activities including walks, sharing stories, music and food.
