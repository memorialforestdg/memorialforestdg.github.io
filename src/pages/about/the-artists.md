__Remembering Together Dumfries and Galloway__ commissioned two artists to co-create the Community Covid Memorial with communities across the region, t s Beall and Katie Anderson. Their process began in 2022, speaking to communities, groups, and individuals across the region –  asking what they would like to be remembered, and what shape or form a Covid Memorial for D&G might take (<a href="../../phase-1">Phase 1</a>, July-Dec 2022). They were then appointed for <a href="../../phase-2.md">Phase 2</a> (July 2023-Sept 2024) to co-create The _Dispersed Memorial Forest_, working with communities across the region.
