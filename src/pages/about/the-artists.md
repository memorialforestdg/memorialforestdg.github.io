[Remembering Together Dumfries and Galloway](https://www.rememberingtogether.scot/dumfries-galloway) commissioned two artists to co-create the Community Covid Memorial with communities across the region, t s Beall and Katie Anderson. Their process began in 2022, speaking to communities, groups, and individuals across the region –  asking what they would like to be remembered, and what shape or form a Covid Memorial for D&G might take (<a href="./phase-1">Phase 1, July-Dec 2022</a>). They were then appointed for <a href="">Phase 2 (July 2023-Sept 2024)</a> to co-create <a href="../about/">The Dispersed Memorial Forest</a>, working with communities across the region.

**Katie Anderson** is a public artist, working across sculpture, installation, sound, lettering, and participatory practice based from her home and studio near Annan. Her practice as an artist is about establishing projects alongside, and as part of, communities – creating work that has its foundations in a sense of place.
