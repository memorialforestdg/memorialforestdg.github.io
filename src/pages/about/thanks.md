## Thank you

[The Artists](the-artists) would like to thank everyone involved in the co-creation of _The Dispersed Memorial Forest_, including: our Site and Community Partners, members of the projectâ€™s Steering Group, Remembering Together staff at Greenspace Scotland, [TreeSurv](https://www.treesurv.co.uk/), and the community groups and organisations across D&G who worked with us to host workshops, conversations, and public events.

Special thanks â€“ and with the utmost respect â€“ to everyone who shared their experiences during the pandemic, and stories of loss and resilience. The conversations, ideas, postcards, _Tree of Remembrance_ ribbons shared with us during workshops and public events collaboratively shaped the Memorial Forest.

The Memorial Forest has been co-created by you, and would not be possible without your voices, stories, and generous contributions. It has been an honour and a privilege to develop, shape, and deliver D&Gâ€™s Covid memorial alongside so many others.

## Makers and Craftspeople

Thanks to the makers, craftspeople, and technical teams that supported the creation and installation of the _Dispersed Memorial Forest_ site markers, working with suppliers, fabricators, and local installation teams to ensure the sculptural markers were beautifully finished: Michelle de Bruin and Hutton Stone, Stephen Murray and the technical team at Edinburgh Sculpture Workshop, Phil Daube, Galloway Granite, K Swan Builders, Dennis Cameron, Grit nâ€™ Polish, A1 Graphics, and Kevin Reid. Thanks also to Border Signs and Graphics for wayfinding signage.
