Following a series of conversational workshops and sharing sessions working with interested groups and individuals where we used a series of creative prompts to discuss ideas including material, form and function of the markers, we then worked up a series of proposals that were shared and developed with each of the five site partners.

The markers have a nice visual relation to one another, but are each uniquely considered for the individual sites, leaning in towards the requirements and personalities of each environment alongside the interests of local people. Working in a range of materials including the familiar red sandstone and Dalbeattie granite, locally sourced oak and bronze, the markers include beautiful benches, ground-set paving designs and sandstone standing stones and way markers.
