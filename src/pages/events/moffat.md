The Memorial Forest at Moffat site is part of the Moffat Community Nature Reserve, once a working quarry and now a haven for wildlife and a wonderful place to explore for local people and visitors to Moffat. The old weigh-bridge is now part of a wildflower meadow, and the sand pits have become wildlife pools.

The Memorial site is marked by paving stones inlaid with bronze, and includes 125 trees planted in a single copse that visitors can walk around and within.
