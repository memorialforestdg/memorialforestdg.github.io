__In co-creating the memorial__, [Commissioned Artists t s Beall and Katie Anderson](../../about/the-artists) worked with communities across Dumfries and Galloway. Over five months in 2022 ([Phase 1](../../about/phase-1)), the Artists brought a sculptural Tree of Remembrance to large public events across D&G, including the Wigtown Book Festival, Stranraer Dandelion Harvest Festival, Kirkcudbright Festival of Light, Castle Douglas Cycling Event, and the Dumfries Rood Fair.

The _Tree of Remembrance_ was designed to evoke Scottish ‘Clootie Trees’ or ‘Clootie Wells’, where the ritual of tying a ribbon or piece of cloth forms a gesture of honouring, healing, and remembrance. This action is echoed around the world in many cultures (also called wishing trees or gift trees), and was felt to be a suitable starting point for Phase 1, considering what shape the Covid Memorial for D&G might take. Over seven public events, more than 95 ribbons were tied to the _Tree of Remembrance_ and donated to the project.

The stories shared as ribbons on the _Tree of Remembrance_ were central to the collaborative process that shaped D&G’s Covid memorial. Some of the handwritten messages from the ribbons have been inscribed onto sandstone markers which are part of _The Dispersed Memorial Forest_.

Over 150 handwritten postcards and _Tree of Remembrance_ ribbons have been donated to the D&G Council’s [Heritage Service](https://www.dumgal.gov.uk/article/24609/Heritage-Service) and are available to view by appointment. Several postcards and ribbons have been donated to [University of Stirling Archives](https://collections.stir.ac.uk/) as part of the national [Remembering Together](https://www.rememberingtogether.scot/) project. These are also available to view by appointment, alongside objects from other Covid Memorial projects across Scotland.
