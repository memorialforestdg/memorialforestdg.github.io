The Dispersed Memorial Forest site in Stranraer is on the grounds of the Galloway Community Hospital. It features a small cluster of native tree species alongside a sandstone and bronze marker. The marker is inscribed with stories of loss and resilience gathered from across the region, including handwritten sentences from NHS staff in Stranraer.

The Community Garden is maintained by volunteers of Stranraer Incredible Edibles, and members of the public are encouraged to pick their own vegetables from the garden while they visit. The garden is an initiative of the D&G Health Board Endowment Fund.
