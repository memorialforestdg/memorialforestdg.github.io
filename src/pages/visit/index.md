## Visiting Dumfries & Galloway's Dispersed Memorial Forest

<br />

The Memorial Forest is planted across Dumfries and Galloway in <a href="./castle-douglas">Castle Douglas</a>, <a href="./dumfries">Dumfries</a>, <a href="./moffat">Moffat</a>, <a href="./sanquhar">Sanquhar</a>, and <a href="./stranraer">Stranraer</a>. Some of the sites are urban, some rural â€“ and together they form the community covid memorial for the region.

The number of trees planted on each site was determined by the site itself, in collaboration with local communities and site partners. The type of native trees planted was also decided in collaboration with local partners, and as recommended by TreeSurv in consideration of which species of trees could thrive in each of the different sites.

More information about each location, including what3words and google map pins and access information, is available on pages:
