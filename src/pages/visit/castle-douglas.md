__Fifty trees have been planted at Threave Nature Reserve__ as part of <i>The Dispersed Memorial Forest</i>. They are accompanied by a bench made of Dalbeattie granite and oak, with a bronze inset.

The planting site is just off the walking path connecting the Nature Reserve to Castle Douglas, and the site was chosen to  encourage visitors to stop and reflect. A variety of native species which suit the landscape were chosen to complement and support NTS Threave’s wider Landscape Restoration Project.
