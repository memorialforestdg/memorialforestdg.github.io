__The Memorial Forest in Sanquhar__ is located at Bell Crescent Park, a playing field and public park located in a residential area. It is bordered by a popular footpath which is part of the <a href="https://dgtrails.org/southern-upland-way/">Southern Upland Way</a> walking route, and has a spectacular view of the area, including nearby Sanquhar Castle.

This site includes a small cluster of trees and a beautiful oak bench. Under the bench are sandstone paving stones, and a bronze inset with handwriting gathered during <a href="../../about/phase-1">Phase 1</a>, “Lockdown Loneliness and Recovering Together.“
