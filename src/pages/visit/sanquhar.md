The Memorial Forest in Sanquhar is located at Bell Crescent Park, a playing field and public park located in a residential area. It is bordered by a popular footpath which is part of the Southern Upland Way walking route, and has a spectacular view of the area, including nearby Sanquhar Castle.

This site includes a small cluster of trees and a beautiful oak bench. Under the bench are sandstone paving stones, and a bronze inset with handwriting gathered during Phase One, “Lockdown Loneliness and Recovering Together.“
